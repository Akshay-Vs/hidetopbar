About:
------

Hides Gnome's topbar except in overview mode.
http://www.bidon.ca
https://github.com/mlutfy/hidetopbar

Based on Finnbarr P. Murphy's extension "autohidetopbar@fpmurphy.com"
http://www.fpmurphy.com/gnome-shell-extensions/

Tested on Gnome 3.6.1.

WARNING: I basically tweaked 2-3 lines from autohidetopbar,
I do not know much about Gnome 3 extensions, so please do not
e-mail me for support! Patches welcomed, however :)

-------------
